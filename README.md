# React-Static - Basic Template

This template was created by running `react-static create` and using the `basic` template option.

Then adding victory to package.json and an example chart to the code.

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

NOTE: if you try to `yarn start` this app with Node17+, it will fail due to the TCPConnect security fix.
